## JavaScript "Design Patterns"

These design patterns are based on what included in [Head First Design Patterns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58128.Head_First_Design_Patterns) book.

Please note the following points:
- We do [duck typing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4205130/what-is-duck-typing)
- We are happy to have PRs (either a fix or addition of another design patterns)
- We code with Node.js v16.4.2 having `app.js` as the entry point of each patterns (`node app.js`)
